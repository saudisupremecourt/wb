Every Muslim in Saudi Arabia can report a Moon sighting to the authorities. Additionally, there are several Moon-sighting committees consisting of Islamic scholars, astronomers, and volunteers. The Supreme Court of Saudi Arabia decides which sighting is legitimate and issues the official starting date of Ramadan.
